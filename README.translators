Some notes for translators
==========================

There are two directories containing translations:

  po/

    Contains the phrases used in the tasksel program.

  tasks/po/

    Contain the phrases used in the tasks themselves.

The text in both these directories need to be translated for the
translation to be complete.

Your language should be listed in LANGS and LANGS_DESC variables
in Makefile.  (LANGS is for translations in po/, and LANGS_DESC
is for translations in tasks/po/.)
