  * When running aptitude in debconf-apt-progress, pass -q to it to disable
    incremental progress displays being logged to stderr, since eg in d-i that
    results in a lot (possibly many megabytes) of download progress info in
    the logs.
  * Support backing up from tasksel if it is run as part of a larger
    debconf-using program such as d-i; while tasksel will not enable the
    backup capb itself, if it is enabled and the user chooses to back up, it
    will exit with code 10. Note that this code, rather than 30, was chosen
    to interoperate with d-i, which rather inexplicably uses 10 instead of 30
    to signal backup across process boundries.

  * Manual package selection is now less of a special case, with an actual
    task entry for it that can have test scripts like other task entries,
    etc.
  * Check for running under the debconf frontend and if it is, do as much as
    possible to avoid outputting non-debconf protocol to stdout, including:
    - Don't display the manual task.
    - Don't clear the screen before running aptitude.
  * Use debconf-apt-progress during installs if available (except if the user
    chooses manual selection), to get a fancy progress bar and completly limit
    output when run inside debconf to debconf protocol output.
  * Use debconf-apt-progress for removals too.

  * Add synaptic to desktop task, as it's very well suited to letting desktop
    users manage their software
  * Uncomment openoffice localised help packages, as their dependencies on
    openoffice.org have been weakened to suggests. So of the openoffice stuff
    commented out in 2.11, only openoffice.org itself remains as an arch all
    package depending on the arch any openoffice.org-bin.
  * Remove openoffice.org-gtk-gnome and openoffice.org-kde from greek-desktop
    as they not greek specific. But they do seem useful, so add them to
    desktop.
  * Split out kde and gnome stuff from desktop into kde-desktop and
    gnome-desktop.
  * Both depend on the main desktop task (so both will be installed if
    available when the desktop task is selected), and both are hidden since
    a user should not need to choose between them.
  * This allows CDs to leave off either KDE or Gnome (or both!) and still
    get a working desktop task.
  * It also allows derivitives to more easily choose to include only one of
    the environments (via preseeding or by unhiding the tasks).

    and use gettext on translatable strings. Closes: #157848
  * Included a slighlty outdated tasks/po/de.po.
  * laptop: to support specific laptop HW, add tcp, mwavem, tpctl, 
    thinkpad-base, i8kutils, and sjog. vaiostat is left commented until
    more than a source package is available. Closes: #201398
  * dialup: Remove anacron. Closes: #202882

  * Remove gnome from desktop Key since neither the metapackage nor all of
    its deps has gone into testing yet, and some deps are not even available
    on some architectures. Closes: #202965
  * Stop #including the deps of packages in Key, since it's pointless and
    only makes it more fragile. #including in Packages is still ok.
  * Don't fail to build on missing key packages, since there might not be an
    apt cache to look at on some buildd's, or it might not include contrib.
  * The gnome-office metapackage vanished. The desktop task already includes
    koffice. OOo is still mired in contrib. Took the best of a bad lot and
    put OOo in as the only office software in the office task.
  * Commented out mozilla-locale-es as the package is currently broken.
  * Rene Engelhard
    - Make all the language tasks pull in OOo and kde langage packages
      consistently.
    - Replace toshutils with toshset which does not need X or a kernel
      interface.

      this package. Closes: #144533
    - Removed broken python-bobo from python task. Closes: #180925
    - The python task is retargeted at providing a subset of the more useful
      python tools, instead of everything. Semi-randomly removed some stuff.
      Someone who uses python might want to take over maintainership of this
      task.
    - Capitalised first letter of every task, in an effort to look
      "professional". Closes: #183109
    - Removed the fortran task, not sufficiently used.

    - Replace netenv (with its nasty boot-time prompt) with guessnet (with
      its slick new ifupdown integration) in laptop task.
    - Add hdparm to laptop task, since many laptop users will want to use it
      to speed up (or turn off!) their disks. Closes: #87450
    - Add menu to office task.
    - Added a java task. Closes: #108061
    - Removed inlined Spanish translation of spanish task. However we should
      add translations, it's not like that!
    - Added a Thai task. Closes: #122663. Needs review since the bug's package
      list was 2 years old.
    - Cleaned up bad wording in most of the descriptions of the
      language-specific tasks.
    - Added sudo to unix-server.
    - Added kernel-compile task for custom kernel building. Closes: #184428
    - Blessed the idea of putting Maintainer fields in individual task files.
    - Removed nonexistant packages from tasks: netscape-zh-resource-477, 
      dialdcost, hanterm, tktabble-dev
    - Put cxterm-ks in korean task to replace hanterm. I hope that's right.
    - Rename mozilla-locale-es to mozilla-locale-es-es.
    - For chinese-t, use doc-linux-zh-text, which provides traditional
      chinese. doc-linux-zh-t went away.

      dselect available file, for more up-to-date information.
    - Shortended the description of c-dev.
    - Renamed Essential field to Key, to prevent confusion.
    - Implemented dropping of tasks that are missing key packages.
    - Enhanced listpackages.pl with support for listing key packages.
    - makedesc.pl too.
    - Key packages do not need to be listed under Packages too.
    - Updated tcl/tk to 8.4.
    - Removed localces from language tasks; language-env depends on it.
    - Changed around what is Key and what is not, more changes than I can
      record here.
    - Don't expand lsb package's deps, we want the whole thing or nothing.
    - Added makeoverride.pl, which will generate an override file from a
      directory of task files.
    - Remove user-de and user-es, language-env superscedes.
    - Back to just gimp for desktop task.
    - If a task is not in the task desc files, but is in the available file
      as a Task: line, do not display it.

  * Added Essential: fields to all task files. The idea is to skip display of

    it easier to make CD's that include some package that happens to be in a
    task, without having to drag in that whole task or get the confusing
    situation of having tasksel display the task, but install only one
    ancillary package from it.

tasksel (1.5) unstable; urgency=high

  * tasksel changes by Anthony Towns
    - data.c: Made tasksel process fields after the long description. This was
      stopping tasksel for handling the new Packages files that actually
      include Task: headers, so it's kinda useful. :)
    - tasksel.c: When no tasks are present, print a trailing newline.

tasksel (1.4) unstable; urgency=high

  * Modifications to existing tasks by Joey Hess
    - added language-env to all language tasks that it supports
    - added netatalk to file-server and print-server
    - renamed modem to dialup, and added stuff for isdn and pppoe to it.
      Also removed a few things like lynx from the task.
    - added aviword to desktop, so there is a basic word processor in there
    - added gimp to desktop too, it's too handy not to be there
    - added lyx to tex
  * New tasks by Joey Hess:
    - web-server -- currently includes only the bare basics, suggestions
      appreciated.
    - unix-server -- a conventional unix server, fully loaded with most of
      the standard unix daemons and userland for console users.
  * Adam Di Carlo:
    - stop shipping upstream ChangeLog
    - number this like a Debian package
    - set urgency to high to cram this into woody for base freeze
    - update our description

 -- Adam Di Carlo <aph@debian.org>  Mon, 28 May 2001 21:03:47 -0400

tasksel (1.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Modifications to existing tasks:
    - Replaced talk of "this [meta]package" with "this task", and like
      changes.
    - In l10n tasks, s/-speaking// for consistency.
    - Make all l10n tasks include locales. It's in base, so this is of
      dubious utility, but some had it and some not.
    - Changed short descriptions of basic-desktop and desktop in an attempt
      to clarify how they're different.
    - Added some comments here and there for unresolved issues.
    - Largely rewrote Debian Jr. descriptions.
    - Added menu to desktop task.
    - Rejiggered mail-server, to be a general purpose mail server, not just
      imap.
    - Moved samba-server to file-server, and made that include nfs stuff
      too.
    - Added a print-server task, that also includes samba, along with other
      stuff.
    - Killed debian-dev(el) task, since it does not meet our task criteria
      -- nowhere near 10% of debian users are debian developers (we hope!),
      and probably not enough regular users will use this package to make
      up the difference. This is my own package, so I'm willing to be
      persuaded otherwise, though..
    - Removed misc window managers from the desktop task. It is unnecessary
      to list them there, since anXious will let the user choose.
    - Killed the demo tasks.
    - Went for consistent capitalization of the short descriptions. Just
      capitalize proper names. I'm not sure if I like this effect, we may
      want to capitalize the first word of each description too.
    - Sundry other changes of little note.
  * Replaced several occurrances of "task packages" with "tasks" elsewhere
    in tasksel.
  * Added -a switch, to show all tasks, even empties. Mostly useful before
    we get tasks into the Packages files, for a global overview of how the
    system will eventually look.
  * Added lint check to makedesc.pl -- it will warn at build time
    about tasks that list unavailable packages. This caught several
    references to virtual packages, etc already, that need to be fixed..
  * VERSION in Makefile automatically tracks this changelog.

tasksel (1.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Joey Hess:
    - Added support for task description files.
    - Read in /usr/share/tasksel/debian-tasks.desc as a task description
      file.
    - Added makedesc.pl, a program to generate a task description file from
      a set of task descriptions.
    - Got rid of all the name prettification code since it is no longer used
      anyway.
    - Killed filterdescription, the task packages in woody actually don't
      have that problem anymore.
    - Don't move cursor to the right after a task is selected.
    - Removed unused tasksel.man from source package (keep pod).
    - Fixed an obscure bug if a task package happened to be the last thing in
      the available file.
    - Enable debug mode by default, but turn it off when building from the
      rules file.

  * Anthony Towns:
    - Fix memory allocation bug when do a fake task- package
    - Port most of the interesting tasks to the tasks file.
    - Fix makedesc.pl to cope with +'s in a task name (c++-dev)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 17 May 2001 14:47:06 -0400

tasksel (1.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use "Section:" fields to break tasks into different sections. Have a
    hardcoded list of default sections, with a defined order; remaining
    sections get added to the end, in alphabetical order. Sections that
    don't match "tasks-*" are ignored.

  * "tasksel install foo bar baz" as a replacement for "apt-get install
    task-foo task-bar task-baz"

  * Increase the size of the "apt-get install" command line buffer.

 -- Anthony Towns <aj@azure.humbug.org.au>  Tue, 15 May 2001 15:02:01 +1000

tasksel (1.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Support "Task:" headers to include a package in a task.
    .
    Syntax is:
        Package: foo
        Task: bar, baz, quux
    .
    Note that tasks still require a task-* package in order to have a
    description. Frontends could conceivably treat a task-foo package
    being installed as meaning "automatically install new packages with
    a Task: foo field, but don't worry about old packages that weren't
    installed", similar to dselect's Standard handling, I think.
    .
    Patch thanks to Anthony Towns <aj@azure.humbug.org.au>
