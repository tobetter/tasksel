  * Remove gnome from desktop Key since neither the metapackage nor all of

    on some architectures. Closes: #202965
  * Stop #including the deps of packages in Key, since it's pointless and
    only makes it more fragile. #including in Packages is still ok.
  * Don't fail to build on missing key packages, since there might not be an
    apt cache to look at on some buildd's, or it might not include contrib.
  * The gnome-office metapackage vanished. The desktop task already includes
    koffice. OOo is still mired in contrib. Took the best of a bad lot and
    put OOo in as the only office software in the office task.
  * Commented out mozilla-locale-es as the package is currently broken.
  * Rene Engelhard
    - Make all the language tasks pull in OOo and kde langage packages
      consistently.

    - Removed broken python-bobo from python task. Closes: #180925
    - The python task is retargeted at providing a subset of the more useful
      python tools, instead of everything. Semi-randomly removed some stuff.
      Someone who uses python might want to take over maintainership of this
      task.

      list was 2 years old.
    - Cleaned up bad wording in most of the descriptions of the
      language-specific tasks.
    - Added sudo to unix-server.
    - Added kernel-compile task for custom kernel building. Closes: #184428
    - Blessed the idea of putting Maintainer fields in individual task files.
    - Removed nonexistant packages from tasks: netscape-zh-resource-477, 
      dialdcost, hanterm, tktabble-dev
    - Put cxterm-ks in korean task to replace hanterm. I hope that's right.
    - Rename mozilla-locale-es to mozilla-locale-es-es.
    - For chinese-t, use doc-linux-zh-text, which provides traditional

    - Changed around what is Key and what is not, more changes than I can
      record here.
    - Don't expand lsb package's deps, we want the whole thing or nothing.
    - Added makeoverride.pl, which will generate an override file from a
      directory of task files.
    - Remove user-de and user-es, language-env superscedes.
    - Back to just gimp for desktop task.
    - If a task is not in the task desc files, but is in the available file
      as a Task: line, do not display it.

tasksel (1.22) unstable; urgency=low

  * Switched from emacs20 to emacs21. Closes: #152018
  * Added Danish language task by Claus Hindsgaul <claus_h@image.dk>.
  * Fixed OOo name. Closes: #158936
  * Patch from Jeff Licquia <licquia@progeny.com> to make tasksel use all
    *.desc files in /usr/share/tasksel, to allow third parties to drop in
     their own additional tasks.
  * This build, at least, will not contain CVS dirs in the source package
    (because I build with DH_ALWAYS_EXCLUDE=CVS set, and pass -ICVS to
    dpkg-buildpackage. Closes: #148759
  * Added wireless-tools to the laptop task as laptops increasingly use
    wireless cards. I think adding wavemon too is a bit too much.
    Closes: #168948
  * Make the tasksel menu entry work as non-root. Closes: #144340

tasksel (1.21) unstable; urgency=low

  * This is aimed at sid, not woody.
  * #include gnome metapackage in desktop task, no need to track gnome
    anymore.
  * Added an "office" task, which will include openoffice when it is in
    debian, and currently includes the stuff in gnome-office. IIRC we three
    talked about such a package for woody, but there did not seem to be enough
    to put in it; there certianly is now.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 20 Jun 2002 16:59:22 -0400

tasksel (1.20) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added Essential: fields to all task files. The idea is to skip display of
    a task if all of its essential packages are not available, which will make
    it easier to make CD's that include some package that happens to be in a
    task, without having to drag in that whole task or get the confusing
    situation of having tasksel display the task, but install only one
    ancillary package from it.
  * Changed python task to use python instead of non-existant python-base.
    This task still needs a lot of work.
  * Updated Danish translation da.po by Claus Hindsgaul <claus_h@image.dk>
  * Updated to use debhelper v4 and misc:Depends; removed outdated copyright
    info from debian/rules.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 18 Mar 2002 01:36:16 -0500

  * (NOT YET UPLOADED)
  * (re-)added french translations. Closes: #136758
  * Renamed Norwegian translations; added nn.po

 -- Randolph Chung <tausq@debian.org>  Mon,  4 Mar 2002 08:54:30 -0800

tasksel (1.18) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Should fix issues with doincludes.pl failing on autobuilders that
    either have no available file, or don't have kde in the availabe file
    (woody systems).

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue, 26 Feb 2002 19:46:02 -0500

tasksel (1.17) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Removed junkbuster from dialup; probably not going to ship with woody, if
    it manages to somehow it is really in too bad shape to expose newbies to
    it. Closes: #131295
  * (Slipstream release foiled by the NI system. :-)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue, 26 Feb 2002 13:30:42 -0500

tasksel (1.16) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Added doincludes.pl, and let the desktop task use it to explode the
    kde metapackage, so its entire dep list is put in the task, and if it does
    not ship with woody, we still will get kde. Closes: #135797
  * The same include mechanism should probably be used for the other
    metapackages, like the junior stuff (and X?). But not right now.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue, 26 Feb 2002 11:17:36 -0500

tasksel (1.15) unstable; urgency=low

  * Include sawfish-gnome in desktop task so gnome will have a WM.
    Closes: #116609, #129999
  * Make the basic-desktop task incude all of x-window-system (so it gets a
    WM and xterm and so on), while the desktop task uses just
    x-window-system-core (because it already has a WM and so on from
    gnome and kde). Closes: #129217
  * Removed pydb from python task, because Colin Watson said to. 
    Closes: #129520
  * it.po translation added, da.po added (Closes: #122668), ja.po updated,
    pt_BR updated (Closes: #122965)

  * Added French task.
  * Merged C and C++ tasks, removed Objective C task.

tasksel (1.5) unstable; urgency=high

  * tasksel changes by Anthony Towns
    - data.c: Made tasksel process fields after the long description. This was
      stopping tasksel for handling the new Packages files that actually
      include Task: headers, so it's kinda useful. :)
    - tasksel.c: When no tasks are present, print a trailing newline.

tasksel (1.4) unstable; urgency=high

  * Modifications to existing tasks by Joey Hess
    - added language-env to all language tasks that it supports
    - added netatalk to file-server and print-server
    - renamed modem to dialup, and added stuff for isdn and pppoe to it.
      Also removed a few things like lynx from the task.
    - added aviword to desktop, so there is a basic word processor in there
    - added gimp to desktop too, it's too handy not to be there
    - added lyx to tex
  * New tasks by Joey Hess:
    - web-server -- currently includes only the bare basics, suggestions
      appreciated.
    - unix-server -- a conventional unix server, fully loaded with most of
      the standard unix daemons and userland for console users.
  * Adam Di Carlo:
    - stop shipping upstream ChangeLog
    - number this like a Debian package
    - set urgency to high to cram this into woody for base freeze
    - update our description

 -- Adam Di Carlo <aph@debian.org>  Mon, 28 May 2001 21:03:47 -0400

tasksel (1.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Modifications to existing tasks:
    - Replaced talk of "this [meta]package" with "this task", and like
      changes.
    - In l10n tasks, s/-speaking// for consistency.
    - Make all l10n tasks include locales. It's in base, so this is of
      dubious utility, but some had it and some not.
    - Changed short descriptions of basic-desktop and desktop in an attempt
      to clarify how they're different.
    - Added some comments here and there for unresolved issues.
    - Largely rewrote Debian Jr. descriptions.
    - Added menu to desktop task.
    - Rejiggered mail-server, to be a general purpose mail server, not just
      imap.
    - Moved samba-server to file-server, and made that include nfs stuff
      too.
    - Added a print-server task, that also includes samba, along with other
      stuff.
    - Killed debian-dev(el) task, since it does not meet our task criteria
      -- nowhere near 10% of debian users are debian developers (we hope!),
      and probably not enough regular users will use this package to make
      up the difference. This is my own package, so I'm willing to be
      persuaded otherwise, though..
    - Removed misc window managers from the desktop task. It is unnecessary
      to list them there, since anXious will let the user choose.
    - Killed the demo tasks.
    - Went for consistent capitalization of the short descriptions. Just
      capitalize proper names. I'm not sure if I like this effect, we may
      want to capitalize the first word of each description too.
    - Sundry other changes of little note.
  * Replaced several occurrances of "task packages" with "tasks" elsewhere
    in tasksel.
  * Added -a switch, to show all tasks, even empties. Mostly useful before
    we get tasks into the Packages files, for a global overview of how the
    system will eventually look.
  * Added lint check to makedesc.pl -- it will warn at build time
    about tasks that list unavailable packages. This caught several
    references to virtual packages, etc already, that need to be fixed..
  * VERSION in Makefile automatically tracks this changelog.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue, 22 May 2001 22:36:00 -0400

tasksel (1.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Joey Hess:
    - Added support for task description files.
    - Read in /usr/share/tasksel/debian-tasks.desc as a task description
      file.
    - Added makedesc.pl, a program to generate a task description file from
      a set of task descriptions.
    - Got rid of all the name prettification code since it is no longer used
      anyway.
    - Killed filterdescription, the task packages in woody actually don't
      have that problem anymore.
    - Don't move cursor to the right after a task is selected.
    - Removed unused tasksel.man from source package (keep pod).
    - Fixed an obscure bug if a task package happened to be the last thing in
      the available file.
    - Enable debug mode by default, but turn it off when building from the
      rules file.

  * Anthony Towns:
    - Fix memory allocation bug when do a fake task- package
    - Port most of the interesting tasks to the tasks file.
    - Fix makedesc.pl to cope with +'s in a task name (c++-dev)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 17 May 2001 14:47:06 -0400

tasksel (1.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use "Section:" fields to break tasks into different sections. Have a
    hardcoded list of default sections, with a defined order; remaining
    sections get added to the end, in alphabetical order. Sections that
    don't match "tasks-*" are ignored.

  * "tasksel install foo bar baz" as a replacement for "apt-get install
    task-foo task-bar task-baz"

  * Increase the size of the "apt-get install" command line buffer.

 -- Anthony Towns <aj@azure.humbug.org.au>  Tue, 15 May 2001 15:02:01 +1000

tasksel (1.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Support "Task:" headers to include a package in a task.
    .
    Syntax is:
        Package: foo
        Task: bar, baz, quux
    .
    Note that tasks still require a task-* package in order to have a
    description. Frontends could conceivably treat a task-foo package
    being installed as meaning "automatically install new packages with
    a Task: foo field, but don't worry about old packages that weren't
    installed", similar to dselect's Standard handling, I think.
    .
    Patch thanks to Anthony Towns <aj@azure.humbug.org.au>
